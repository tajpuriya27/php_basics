# PHP_Basics

Git repository that contains all the php code that I created to understand and it's main branch will have refactor code for future reference.

## How to run PHP Code:

Hypertext PreProcessor(PHP) is server side scripting language i.e. it runs on server. We need server(Apache is popularly used) and PHP itself to run PHP code.

- Install any local server environment like XAMPP, MAMP, WAMP, Lalagron etc
- Install PHP via php.net.
  > Some server enviornment(XAMPP) may automatically install PHP in your system.
